      contents: `Hi there, this is Yingchi. 
      The Mogutable team has decided to start a mini series to share some of our favorite recipes. Starting from my go-to dish in the fall, the Claypot Sesame Oil Chicken Rice. Inspired by a Taiwanese dish Sesame Oil Chicken Soup (麻油雞), this dish is essentially a non-soup version of the Taiwanese dish. Same ingredients, same flavor, but with steamed rice.`,

      title: "STEPS (01 OF 02)",
      contents: `1. Soak the goji berries in the cooking rice wine. Sit aside. This step gives the goji berries some of the flavors from the rice wine and also helps the berries to be moisturized. 

      2. Put sliced ginger in the clay pot (If you don't have a clay pot, regular wok or pan are good too), turn the heat on to low heat. Wait until the ginger looks a little bit dry.

      3. Add toasted sesame oil. Cook the ginger in low heat for about 2-3 minutes. It's important to use low heat only for this step as sesame oil will develop a bitter taste if the temperature gets too hot.

      4. Add the diced chicken breast. Use medium heat. Lightly cook it until the color of the meat changes.`,
